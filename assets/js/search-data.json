            "content": "How to Start Blogging . You are planning to do incredible things. It would be nice if someone else would know about it too. So you decided that you want to have a blog. . Motivation . Who wants to spend hours or days just to setup a blog? Honestly, no one. You either go for a blogging site like a self hosted site engine (e.g. Wordpress), or you use one of the blooging site (e.g. Medium). The first requires a significant learning effort at the start, while the second may have limitations on the eyeballs you can reach (e.g., paywall or ads). . Or you can use Github Pages with the help of a great tool: fastpages coming from the fast.ai powerhouse. . Solution . Fastpages enables you to focus on the content of your blog. You write your posts into a Markdown file (or to a Jupyter Notebook) and you get a nice blog like the one you are reading right now. . Figure out the topic, write the post, and commit to the Github repository of your blog. You are done. . Wish I knew before . If you search for blogging and fast.ai you may end up reading about fast_template. Read for about it for motivation and then use fastpages. More flexibility and ease of use. | The repository containing the blog should be public, unless you have a Pro subscription (to have Pages functionality on Github). | Use quotation marks in the description to avoid Jekyll build failure. | .",
