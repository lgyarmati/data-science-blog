            "content": "How to Start Blogging . You are planning to do incredible things. It would be nice if someone else would know about it too. So you decided that you want to have a blog. . Motivation . Who wants to spend hours or days just to setup a blog? Honestly, no one. You either go for a blogging site like a self hosted site engine (e.g. Wordpress), or you use one of the blooging site (e.g. Medium). The first requires a significant learning effort at the start, while the second may have limitations on the eyeballs you can reach (e.g., paywall or ads). . Or you can use Github Pages with the help of a great tool: fastpages coming from the fast.ai powerhouse. . Solution . Fastpages enables you to focus on the content of your blog. You write your posts into a Markdown file (or to a Jupyter Notebook) and you get a nice blog like the one you are reading right now. . Figure out the topic, write the post, and commit to the Github repository of your blog. You are done. . Wish I knew before . If you search for blogging and fast.ai you may end up reading about fast_template. Read for about it for motivation and then use fastpages. More flexibility and ease of use. | The repository containing the blog should be public, unless you have a Pro subscription (to have Pages functionality on Github). | Use quotation marks in the description to avoid Jekyll build failure. | .",

            "title": "An Example Markdown Post",
            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png . Formatting text as YAML: . key: value - another_key: &quot;another value&quot; . Tables . Column 1 Column 2 . A thing | Another thing | . Tweetcards .
